📖 About the Project
This project is a collection of 6 chapters focusing on identity, ambition, and strategy. It moves away from the rigid "school mindset" and introduces a "fluid philosophy" for the modern student.

This manual is my first experiment in long-form storytelling. Moving from a background in poetry, I wanted to create a structured narrative that resonates with past, present, and future students.

Collaboration: Written and structured by Jaisarves M with creative assistance from Gemini AI to refine the voice and logic.
